We also have two small, non-shedding, very well-behaved dogs, Daisy and Lily. They are toy poodle bichon crosses, 10 and 9 years old. We adore dogs, and understand that your pooch would perhaps like to check out our dogs before accepting house guests, which could be easily arranged. Please let me know if you would like any further information about us or our dogs, and whether you would like to meet up at a local dog park prior to making up your mind. We'd be interested in staying from this Sunday but could make it Monday or Tuesday if that would suit you better. Thanks Jude.",1,,,1,1,,,,

"HiI was thinking about making a booking during the Xmas or either new year week for 7 days. We are a group of 8 adults that come with 9 kids ( so total in bodies would be 17). All expect 1 child(who just turned 12 yesterday) is under 7, so most of them would share a bed or mattress with a sibling or share a bed with a parent. In your price you've advertised does that include children or jst adults? And if so, cos were over your max.12 ppl limit do we have to pay full price for the extra 5 children. Reading your detail section, we do not need any extra beds or mattress, cos as I said earlier the kids share a bed with there siblings. In your price that's stated in U.S. Dollars, is that for per night or for the week? Jst want to make it clear that's all, but I pretty much get the idea. Also cos off the time we want to stay, which is either fall during the Xmas or new year period, do we have to pay extra for that? Would u b so kindly b able to give me a total price for 8adults and 9 children to stay for 7 days either on the week or Xmas or new year.

See more at:(http://-------.---/) and read about him.We were married for twenty years without a child and divorced two years ago.Please I know this may come to you by surprise because you did not know me, I needed your assistance that was why I write you through divine direction, it is my desire of going into charity relationship with you.I have a concealed trunk box containing the sum of USD$12.8million with private security firm in Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, This fund emanated from African Rainbow Minerals which is a mining company owed by my ex husband.Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem, though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a person that will use this fund to help build bridges to foster cultural understanding, develop communities, empower women, enable youth, provide vital disaster relief and create a more tolerant and accepting world,cater for Orphans,Widows,Victims of natural and man made disaster,Homeless people and research centers and to ensure that the my little contribution is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I have seen the wicked side of the world and man's wickedness to fellow human being. I have decided before my death to use this money to work for humanity.I am not afraid of death hence I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will like you to understand that my contact to you is a divine direction from God;",,,,,,,,,1

"Hello Patric,My name is Ulla Angell I am 18 years old and from London. I will be visiting Tokyo for 10 days and was wondering if I could stay with you and your family in your lovely home. I arrive at Narita Airport on the 15th at 1:15pm and my flight departs on the 24th at 9:20pm. My reason for visiting Tokyo not to mention for the first time is that I have always loved the culture, fashion and art since being exposed to it from a young age it has always been a dream of mine to go. I want to explore the city and document it using my old vhs camcorder and my camera, I hope to learn a lot from this amazing experience and look forward to hearing from you.Kind regards,Ulla",1,,,,,,,,

Hi Alexander... I am travelling to Melbourne on October 9 with my Mum to visit my daughter who lives in Heidelberg Heights. I've always stayed out her way when coming to visit but thought your place looked like a bit of an exciting change and much closer to the city. I see you have a few apartments that you rent out so thought it was worth messaging you to see if you have anything available for these dates (9-15 October). I would really need a carpark and preferable 2 bedrooms and your listed rates seem pretty good for what we want. Do you have anything that would suit? ThanksKind regardsSharon,1,,,1,,,,,

"Good morning, my name is Ericka, I'm Mexican but living in Italy. I lived in Lyon when I was 18, but unfortunately I lost my French. During that time I loved to visit Paris as often as I could. We are planning to visit for a week during New Year's Eve Paris, for later go to Disneyland the week after. I will like to know more about your apartment, because we are a family of 4. My sons will be 4 and the little one 7 months. My hubby is an excellent chef and he relax a lot preparing dinner, so we would love to find fresh an local ingredients at the food markets nearby, and go out for lunch with the kids. Are there food street markets around? By the other hand, the DVDs player will be highly appreciate by my older son, Leonardo, in winter we love to see Disney movies -of course I'll bring them with me ;) Do you have a baby bed? I don't know if Patrizio (7 months then) will not fall from the normal bed and we are not use to sleep together with him. Both rooms are near? With the buggy is easier to use the bus, is the stop nearby? And the metro? We want to make a normal daily life in Paris with our little kids. As you can see, we are a family who is trying to make family vacations with quality time, at a gorgeous city as Paris.Looking forward to hear from you soon!!",1,,1,1,1,1,,,
